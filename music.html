					<h3>K-POP</h3>
					<p>K-pop, short for Korean popular music, is a genre of music originating in<br> South Korea as part of South Korean Culture. It is influenced by styles<br> and genres from around the world, such as pop, experimental, rock, jazz,<br> gospel, hip hop, R&B, reggae, electronic dance, folk, country, and classical<br> on top of its tradtional korean music roots. The more modern form of the<br> genre emerged with the formation of one of the earliest K-pop groups,<br> the boy band Seo Taiji and Boys, in 1992. Their experimentation with<br> different styles and genres of music and integration of foreign musical<br> elements helped reshape and modernize South Korea's contemporary<br> music scene.</p>

					<h3>RAP AND R&B</h3>
					<p>Rapping (also rhyming, spitting, emceeing or MCing) is a musical form<br> of vocal delivery that incorporates « hyme, rhythmic speech, and street<br> vernacular »,which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually<br> over a backing beat or musical accompaniment. Rap being a primary<br> ingredient of hip-hop music, it is commonly associated with that genre in<br> particular; however, the origins of rap predate hip-hop culture by many<br> years.
					Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or R'n'B, is a genre of<br> popular music that originated in African-American communities in the<br> 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe<br> recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a<br> time when "urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent<br> beat" was becoming more popular.</p>

					<h3>POP</h3>
					<p>Pop is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form<br> during the mid-1950s in the United States and the United Kingdom. The<br> terms popular music and pop music are often used interchangeably,<br> although the former describes all music that is popular and includes<br> many disparate styles. During the 1950s and 1960s, pop music<br> encompassed rock and roll and the youth-oriented styles it influenced.<br> Rock and pop music remained roughly synonymous until the late 1960s,<br> after which pop became associated with music that was more<br> commercial, ephemeral, and accessible.</p>
